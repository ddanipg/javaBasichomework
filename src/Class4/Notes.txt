Operators:
Operators are different symbols that we can use to perform operations like addition
compare things if two entities are same or not, if a number is greater than the other number or not.
there are three main types of operators. they are arithmetic operators, relational operators and logical operators.
Arithmetic Operators:
we use Arithmetic operators to perform simple math operations like addition, substraction etc.
+ => addition
- => subtraction
/ => division
* => multiplication
% => modulus, remainder

relational operators- // do not work with String
are used to compare two quantities or entities, for example if something is bigger than other thing or if two numbers
are the same or not, or if 2 boolean variables contain same values or not.
 ==  used to check if two variables contain the same value or not, if same we get true otherwise we get false.
 !=  used to check if two variables do not contain the same value. we get a true if they are not same.
 >  used to check if one value is greater than other value or not. if greater we get a true if not greater we get false
 < used to check if one value on the left is smaller than the value on the right side we will get true.
 >= if the value on left is greater or equal to if either if those 2 thing is true we will get true as a result.
 <= is opposite of greater than, and it is used to check if something is less or equal to  other thing.

 conditional constructs
 used to write conditional code. A piece of code that execute based on a condition if condition is true java execute
 the code otherwise it skips that code.
 how to write if else conditions:
 if(condition){
 any line of code even another if condition
 if(){
 }
 }
 important notes:
 1) for String we use equals method indtead of == sign because is a non-primitive data type


   If else conditions:
   If i have to test the same variable for multiple conditions I should use If else If
   If I have multiple conditions and these conditions are dependent on each other I should use the Nested if conditions.
