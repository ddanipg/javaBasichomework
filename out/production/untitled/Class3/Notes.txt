 what are variables?
 variables are containers or boxes in the memory that can hold the data for us.

 why we need variables?
 before we can ask the computer to do something for us we need to store the information and instructuions in a file then
 we feed those to the computer and computer that thing for us.
  *WE ARE AUTOMATION TESTERS*

  how to create the variables (syntax):
  1) we need to tell the computer what type of box/container/variable we need.
  2)we need to give a name to the box.
